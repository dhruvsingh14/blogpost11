So, here are my ideas for this next blog post ahead.

It's central theme is going to be around transportation. 

However, if we don't know where we're going - we may just end up downloading a bunch of data, and dithering a bunch.

So here are some questions i'm raising at the outset. that can be refined as we go along.


- how many cars are on the road

- how have they decreased over a period of time?

- who are the primary manufacturers of cars? where?

- how do trucks and buses compare to regular cars for moving people?

- how has public transportation evolved over the years?

In this post we won't examine airplanes, aircrafts, or freight trains / freight ships.

Neither will we look at military vehicles. 

What we will however try to identify is this. 

--------------------------------------------

Let's restrict our analysis to private vehicles, and public transit, and compare the two.

But also including some freight trucks in there. Since there is a certain romanticism to it.

Possibly by region. Ideally including some geographic maps.

--------------------------------------------

adding a section on consumer expenditure here

--------------------------------------------


For instance, chloropleths of private vehicles, and public transit. 

But also of truck routes if possible.


----------------------------------------------

Lastly, we may wanna briefly touch on motor vehicle accidents. Since that is always a pressing concern. 

And handle the matter sensitively. 

----------------------------------------------

And in closing talk about the issue of self driving cars. 

and manufacturing data. 

----------------------------------------------

price data seems to be very hard to find.

----------------------------------------------

let us begin by cleaning some of the datasets tomorrow, 

finding some metrics to measure. then narrowing down our focus.
